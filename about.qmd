Thanks for checking out my website! I consider myself a quantitative community ecologist interested in leveraging long-term existing data sets to understand how species respond to their environment and with each other. I received my Bachelor's degree in *Environmental and Conservation Biology* from Kent State University (2021), then a Master's degree in *Biology* from the University of Central Arkansas (2023). Currently, I am a PhD student in *Biological Sciences* at the University of South Carolina working the lab of Dr. Tad Dallas.

In my spare time, I like to read fantasy novels, play video games, or go for a hike with my partner in science, my pup, Maverick!
