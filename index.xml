      <description>I am a PhD student in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of South Carolina. I orginally started my academic journey as an undergrad at Kent State University (Kent, Ohio) where I majored in Environmental and Conservation Biology. While at Kent, I conducted undergraduate research with Dr. Dave Costello understanding nutrient decomposition and immobilization in urban streams. After Kent, I began a Masters program at the University of Central Arkansas (Conway, Arkansas) where I worked with Dr.</description>

      <description>1. metaPatch In this experiment, I am leveraging the Tribolium system and 3d printing tools to study the effects of habitat fragmentation and density dependence on metapopulation dynamics. The goal is to understand how patch size influences overall metapopulation size and dynamics.&#xA;Keep up with the project: https://github.com/anthony-pignatelli/metaPatch&#xA;3D Printed Habitats at different levels of fragmentation. 2. streamSync This project (which is in review) was aimed at understanding the role of environmental variability on community synchrony in freshwater macroinvertebrates.</description>
