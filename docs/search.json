    "text": "At the top of Green Mountain in Boulder, CO\n\n\nThanks for checking out my website! I consider myself a quantitative community ecologist interested in leveraging long-term existing data sets to understand how species respond to their environment and with each other. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Environmental and Conservation Biology from Kent State University (2021), then a Master’s degree in Biology from the University of Central Arkansas (2023). Currently, I am a PhD student in Biological Sciences at the University of South Carolina working the lab of Dr. Tad Dallas.\nIn my spare time, I like to read fantasy novels, play video games, or go for a hike with my partner in science, my pup, Maverick!\n\n\n\nMaverick and I hiking on the Palmetto Trail in Columbia, SC"

While similar to my interests in synchrony, here I am trying to understand what drivers of population variability are more impactful on population dynamics."

Many studies of habitat fragmentation take place in large field systems where it is difficult to parse out different effects of fragmentation on population dynamics.\nUsing the Tribolium flour beetle system, I am trying to look at the effects of habitat fragmentation per se on population dynamics, that is, simply the separation of habitat patches but not removing amount of habitat.\n\n\n\n\n3D printed habitat patches.

Here, I am very interested in food web dynamics and nutrient cycling from basal food resources up to the consumer (either macroinvertebrates or fish). I’m particularly interested in how urbanization and land use change affect these aquatic communities from physical characteristics to biodiversity.\nI have studied food web dynamics by considering the ecological stoichiometry of resources and consumers and how the ratios of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus change through the food web."
